                {company} operates the {service} service, which we hope you use. If you use it, please use it
                responsibly.
                If you don't, we'll have to terminate your account and access.
            </p>
            <p>
                For paid accounts, you'll be charged on a monthly basis. You can cancel anytime, but there are no
                refunds.

                The Terms of Service, {service} itself, and our prices can change at any time. We'll warn you 30 days in

                or {service},

                That's the basic idea, but You must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with all
                the
                details before You use any of our sites (whether or not you have created an account).

            <p>
                In order to use the Service, You (the "Customer", "You", or "Your") must first agree to the Terms. You
                understand and agree that {company} will treat Your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from
                that
                point onwards.

            <p>
                {company} may make changes to the Terms from time to time. You may reject the changes by terminating
                Your
                account. You understand and agree that if You use the Service after the date on which the Terms have
                changed, {company} will treat Your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.
